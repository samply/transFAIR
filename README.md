# Transfyr

## Introduction

Transfyr is intended to be a ready-to-use tool (turnkey solution) for data integration for medical institutions. Instead of creating own ETL processes by hand, this tool facilitates certain data integration tasks like:

- **E**xtraction from source systems
- **T**ransformation into target schemata
- **L**oading into target systems

## Setup Develop

To Setup a development environment start two FHIR servers on localhost.

Fill the first FHIR server with testdata and run the batch job in your IDE
Check the second FHIR server to see how your data was transferred.
